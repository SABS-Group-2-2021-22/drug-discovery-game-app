                        MMP-12 is an 18 kDa, monomeric enzyme implicated in emphysema and
                        asthma, and has been identified
                        as a target with therapeutic potential. Your job is to design a potent inhibitor of MMP12 with
                        good lipophilicity, medium to high permeability, and good metabolic stability. You have
                        30 weeks and Â£100,000 to design, assay, and screen your
                        molecules. At the end you will have to pick a final molecule to take forward.
